## correcting boundary mismatch in the 1991 &amp; 1996 Canadian censuses

The geographic boundary files for the 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses contain substantial spatial mismatch error. We have corrected some of these boundaries using a conflation procedure in order to align them with boundaries from other census years.

Data for these is also being uploaded to [Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/corrected_census_boundaries_1991_1996)
